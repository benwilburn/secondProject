				<p>
					I have a husky/german sheppard mix! His name is bandit because when he was a puppy it looked like he was wearing a mask on his face.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have a skipperke, named Dallas, who I adopted when I was in college! He has really back allergies and his eyes are always swollen.

					Recently, my aunt passed away and I have been looking after her dog, Scupper. She is really shy and she will only come up to you if you're completely still.
