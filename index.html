					I have a husky/german sheppard mix! His name is bandit because when he was a puppy it looked like he was wearing a mask on his face.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also have a skipperke, named Dallas, who I adopted when I was in college! He has really back allergies and his eyes are always swollen.

					Recently, my aunt passed away and I have been looking after her dog, Scupper. She is really shy and she will only come up to you if you're completely still.

					I have 2 orange cats that my family rescued. Their names are Petey & Simba. Petey only comes around people he knows & likes. Simba does not come around. At all. He barely even lets me touch him, but most of the time he just hides.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have one tabby cat. A friend brought the cat to me because he needed a good home, because he has 4 legs but only 3 paws. We don't know what actually happened to his paw but he definitely does not like people touching it. I gave him a fitting name: Peggy! He will steal your drink straw.
